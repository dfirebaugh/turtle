# The Turtle Console Emulator
Turtle is a [fantasy console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_video_game_console) emulator.
The intention of turtle is to make it easy to make games.

## Turtle Scripting
There is a subset of the lua scripting language embedded in turtle.
Some example turtle scripts (aka `carts`) exist in the `./examples` dir.

you can load these carts by building the project and then running the following:
```bash
./turtle -cart ./examples/simple.lua
```

Alternatively, you can run these directly in the web browser.

## Chips
Turtle has `chips`.  `Chips` are really just convenience libraries that are available to the `carts` (carts are intended to represent game cartridges.)
